            <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I currently live in Perth and recruit within IT, Data & Analytics specifically.</p>
        <p>Technology is incredibly exciting. What you can do with it, compared to a few years ago is amazing.<br>
        I would love to be in a developer role where I can learn from awesome people, working with Javascript creating fantastic software.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I can create websites and have built a few simple webapps with Javascript</p>
            <p>I haven't got a natural flair for design, however the UI/UX area is very intriguing and somewhere I'd like to expand my knowledge.</p> 
            <p>Semantic HTML is something I focus on, for accessability and readability. I'm working on my CSS to improve this using things like 
                functions and variables.

             <h2>Goals for the future</h2>
        <p>I'm aware that getting a good ground in HTML and CSS is very important, so creating more projects and landing pages like these in the next few months with be a key goal. I'd like to have 4-5.</p>
        <p>Once I have a better understanding, picking up either SASS or LESS will be next on the list.</p>
        <p>Having a good grounding in Vanilla Javascript will be my goal within 6 months, with the aim of picking up something like React.js (due to popularity).</p>
